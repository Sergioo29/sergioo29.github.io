    <p class="plot summary">
        In a suspicious world that resembles the Earth, a story about science fiction and afterlife takes place. 
        The world setting is that every city has boundaries and heavy guarding. The reason for it is that there 
        are monsters wandering around the earth, and most of them are aggressive towards humans. The origin of those 
        monsters is something that is been treated as a top secret from the government, as if their origin should not
        be known for the people`s sake. We first are presented to a group of four main protagonists: Saju, Kashi, Vito,
        and Mizo. They are all 19 years old, finishing the summer camp of their last year in high school. During the camping,
        they are attacked by a pair of magical creatures that almost put them to death. They are found by the other school mates
        and taken to the hospital. After some months recovering, they are finally free to go home, and they gather in one of the
        character's houses to talk about the incident. During the talk, one of the characters could remember a lot of details, 
        saying some of the things the creatures have said to them. We then go into an adventure with the protagonists to find 
        answers about the creatures, and other mysteries that are presented during the first episodes. Prepare to embark on a 
        journey full of epic battles, superpowers, unravels, new worlds and more.
